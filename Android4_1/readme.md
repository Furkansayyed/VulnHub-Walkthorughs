## Getting the Ip Address of Target Device:

![device screen](screenshots/screen.png)

I will be using arp-scan to scan my local network and get the ip address of the target device

> target ip -> 192.168.100.11

## Scanning the Target 

Using nmap to scan the device for open ports

```bash

â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop/Machines_WriteUps/Android_1]
â””â”€$ nmap -sV 192.168.100.11 -oN nmap_full_scan

## Exploitation

Let's go with port 8080, it is a http service, lets open it up in browser and see if we got some clues

Here I dont get any clues or flag in the http services I even used Gobuster to find the hidden dirs but nothing interesting...
